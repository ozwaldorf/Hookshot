"""Widescreen and ultrawide for Ocarina of Time 1.1.1: C added after a few instructions of the game (a64_lift.py Lifter.after).

The game draws a 2560x1440 picture whatever the screen and renders its scene at 1920x1080; its cameras use a 16:9 ratio.
With these patches the picture takes the window's shape (the height stays the game's, the width grows on an ultrawide
screen and shrinks on a 16:10 or 4:3 one), the 16:9 cameras take the picture's ratio, the HUD and menus keep their 16:9
shape in the middle of a wider picture (a narrower one: its whole width), pre-rendered movies play in that middle 16:9,
and the picture a save keeps shows that middle 16:9 (a narrower picture: its middle band, at the texture's shape). Every patch reads host globals
(host/hos_wide.c) that stay 0 for a 16:9 window, so the game runs as shipped then.

The sites and what each does come from NX2navi's recomp/patches-v111.txt, where they are credited to Ivan0xFF (MIT,
"The matrix-update, UI and movie sites: Copyright (c) 2026 Ivan0xFF"); the picture and scene size sites are the same
constants that file names; the save picture's site is Hookshot's own (issue 952). Here each is written as C after the
original instruction instead of a replacement of it.
Each site's original instruction word is checked: another game version leaves the site out (and says so).
